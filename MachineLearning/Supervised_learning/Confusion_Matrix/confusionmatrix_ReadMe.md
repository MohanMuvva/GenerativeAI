# Logistic Regression Model Analysis

This script demonstrates the use of logistic regression to predict sgtf (S gene target failure) from collected samples on specific dates, emphasizing model evaluation through confusion matrices and classification reports.

## Script Functionality
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Loads the dataset and performs necessary preprocessing steps, including scaling features and encoding categorical variables.
- **Model Building**: Implements a logistic regression model, optimized by grid search for the best regularization parameter.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance using a confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy metrics.

##Usage
Prepare your environment:
Install the required Python packages.
##Run the Script:
python confusionmatrix.py
##Outputs
Model Performance Metrics: Outputs the confusion matrix, accuracy score, and a detailed classification report.
Visualization: Displays a plot of the trained logistic regression modelâ€™s coefficients for interpretability.
##Concluding Note
This script is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate the application of logistic regression in binary classification tasks within the medical field, particularly for predicting sgtf. The model's effectiveness is assessed primarily through accuracy and the detailed insights provided by the confusion matrix and classification report.

##Additional Features
Hyperparameter Tuning: Includes grid search to find the optimal regularization parameter.
Feature Engineering: Offers insights into possible enhancements by including domain-specific feature engineering, though it's outside the scope of this script.
