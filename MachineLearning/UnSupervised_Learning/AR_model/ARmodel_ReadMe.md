# Autoregressive Model for Time Series Forecasting

This script demonstrates how to build and use an autoregressive (AR) model for time series forecasting.

## Script Functionality
- **Data Loading**: Imports time series data from a CSV file.
- **AR Model Fitting**: Fits an autoregressive model to the data.
- **Forecasting**: Uses the model to make forecasts.

##Usage
Prepare your data: Ensure the dataset is correctly formatted for time series analysis.
Run the Script:
python ARmodel.py
##Outputs
Forecasts: Outputs the forecasted values for the specified future points.
Model Summary: Displays the summary statistics of the AR model.
##Concluding Note
This script is useful for those interested in learning and applying basic time series forecasting techniques in Python.

##Additional Features
Model Diagnostics: Includes diagnostics to assess the fit of the model.
Visualization: Generates plots to visualize the forecasts against actual data.
##Contributing
Contributions to improve the script or extend its functionality are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request.
