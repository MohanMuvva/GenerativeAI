# Density-Based Clustering for Data Analysis

This Python script demonstrates how to perform density-based clustering using DBSCAN to identify clusters of varying shapes and densities in a dataset.

## Script Functionality
- **Data Preprocessing**: Loads and preprocesses data for clustering.
- **DBSCAN Clustering**: Applies DBSCAN algorithm to detect clusters based on density.
- **Visualization**: Plots the clustering results to visualize the distribution of data points.

##Usage
Prepare your environment:
Install the necessary libraries.
Run the Script:
python Density_cluster.py
##Outputs
Cluster Plots: Visual outputs of clusters identified by DBSCAN.
Console Outputs: Summarizes the number of clusters and noise points.
##Concluding Note
This script is useful for exploratory data analysis to understand inherent groupings in complex datasets.

##Additional Features
Parameter Tuning: Provides flexibility to adjust DBSCAN parameters like eps and min_samples.
Expandability: Can be extended to include other clustering algorithms for comparison.
##Contributing
Contributors are welcome to enhance the clustering analysis or improve the visualization features.
