# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

This Python script demonstrates how to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while retaining most of the information.

## Script Functionality
- **Data Preprocessing**: Standardizes the dataset.
- **PCA Execution**: Performs PCA to reduce dimensions.
- **Visualization**: Plots the principal components to visualize the results.

#Usage
Prepare your dataset:
Make sure your data is loaded and formatted correctly.
##Run the Script:
python PCA.py
##Outputs
Eigenvalues Plot: Shows the variance explained by each principal component.
Scree Plot: Visualizes the cumulative variance explained with increasing number of components.
##Concluding Note
PCA is an effective tool for data analysis and feature engineering, particularly useful in preprocessing steps for predictive modeling.

##Additional Features
Scalability: Adapt the script to handle larger datasets or more complex structures.
Interactivity: Add parameters to adjust the number of components dynamically.
##Contributing
Contributions to extend functionality or enhance visualization aspects are welcome.
