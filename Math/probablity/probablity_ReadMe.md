 Patient Prime Risk Score Probability

This Python script assesses the probability of a patient having a prime number as their risk score, offering a detailed simulation of patient risk assessment.

## Script Functionality
- **Risk Score Generation**: Produces odd risk scores for patients.
- **Prime Evaluation**: Determines if each risk score is prime.
- **Probability Analysis**: Calculates the probability of a patient having a prime risk score.
- **Simulation of Selection**: Simulates the selection of patients and categorizes them based on their risk score's primality.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Libraries: `math`, `random`

## Usage
1. **Setup**:
   - No additional setup required besides having Python installed.
2. **Execution**:
 
   python probablity.py

##Outputs
   Detailed Outputs: Lists total patients, how many have prime risk scores, and the corresponding probability.
   Simulation Output: Provides a demonstration of how patients would be selected and classified.
##Concluding Note
   Ideal for those interested in statistical methods within healthcare analytics, this script combines simple probabilistic models with practical healthcare simulations.

##Additional Features
   Expandability: The script could be adapted to include more complex probabilistic models or integrate with a real-world healthcare database for live data processing.
