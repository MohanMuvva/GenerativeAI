# Prime Risk Score Analysis

This Python script calculates the probability of selecting a patient with a prime risk score from a dataset of 1000 patients.

## Script Functionality
- **Data Generation**: Generates a list of patient IDs and their associated odd risk scores.
- **Prime Check**: Identifies whether each risk score is a prime number.
- **Probability Calculation**: Computes the probability of selecting a patient whose risk score is a prime number.
- **Simulation**: Simulates patient selection to identify the risk category based on the prime status of their scores.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Libraries: `math`, `random`

## Usage
1. **Run the Script**:
   python usecase.py

##Outputs
Probability: Displays the total number of patients, the number with prime risk scores, and the probability of selecting such a patient.
Simulation Results: Shows outcomes of simulated patient selections, indicating risk level.
##Concluding Note
This script is valuable for understanding patterns in health risk assessments, specifically through the lens of statistical probability and prime number theory.
