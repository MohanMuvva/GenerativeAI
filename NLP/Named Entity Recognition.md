# Named Entity Recognition (NER) Notebook

## Script Functionality
This notebook demonstrates the process of Named Entity Recognition (NER), a key technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) used to identify and categorize entities such as names, locations, and organizations in text.

The notebook covers:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to clean and prepare text data for NER.
2. **NER Model Training or Application**: Use of NER models, possibly with libraries like `spaCy` or `nltk`.
3. **Entity Extraction**: Identification of entities and their categorization.
4. **Evaluation**: Metrics and methods to assess model accuracy.

## Requirements
The following libraries are required:
- `nltk`
- `spacy`
- `pandas`

Install these with:

pip install nltk spacy pandas
Usage
Load the notebook in Jupyter:

jupyter notebook named_entity.ipynb

Run each cell sequentially to preprocess data, train the NER model, and view identified entities.

##Outputs:

Processed Data: Cleaned text data ready for entity extraction.

Entity Extraction Results: A list of identified entities with their categories.

Visualization (Optional): Displays entities in the text for better understanding.
##Concluding Note:
This notebook provides an introduction to NER and its applications, useful for information extraction in many real-world scenarios. Modify and expand the code to work with various datasets for specific entity types.
