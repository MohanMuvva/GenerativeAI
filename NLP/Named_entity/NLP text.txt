Data preprocessing: Before a model processes text for a specific task, the text often needs to be preprocessed to improve model performance or to turn words and characters into a format the model can understand. Data-centric AI is a growing movement that prioritizes data preprocessing. Various techniques may be used in this data preprocessing:
Stemming and lemmatization: Stemming is an informal process of converting words to their base forms using heuristic rules. For example, “university,” “universities,” and “university’s” might all be mapped to the base univers. (One limitation in this approach is that “universe” may also be mapped to univers, even though universe and university don’t have a close semantic relationship.) Lemmatization is a more formal way to find roots by analyzing a word’s morphology using vocabulary from a dictionary. Stemming and lemmatization are provided by libraries like spaCy and NLTK. 
Sentence segmentation breaks a large piece of text into linguistically meaningful sentence units. This is obvious in languages like English, where the end of a sentence is marked by a period, but it is still not trivial. A period can be used to mark an abbreviation as well as to terminate a sentence, and in this case, the period should be part of the abbreviation token itself. The process becomes even more complex in languages, such as ancient Chinese, that don’t have a delimiter that marks the end of a sentence.
