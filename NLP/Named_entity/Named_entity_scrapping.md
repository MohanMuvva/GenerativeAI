Named Entity Recognition with Web Scraping Notebook
Script Functionality
This notebook combines web scraping with Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract and analyze meaningful entities from text collected from web pages. The workflow includes:

##Web Scraping: Scrapes content from a specified URL, such as news articles, blog posts, or other textual content.
Text Preprocessing: Cleans the scraped text by removing unwanted elements like HTML tags, special characters, and stopwords.
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Applies NLP techniques to identify and categorize named entities, such as:
People (PERSON)
Organizations (ORG)
Locations (GPE)
Dates, times, and other named entities.

##Visualization: Optionally visualizes extracted entities within the context of the text or as a list.
Requirements
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

##Web Scraping:
requests
beautifulsoup4

NLP:
nltk

Optionally, matplotlib or seaborn for visualizations.
You can install the required dependencies using:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 nltk spacy matplotlib

If using spaCy, download the required language model:


python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

Usage
Set Up the Notebook:

Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook named_entity_scrapping.ipynb

Specify the URL:

Update the variable in the notebook with the desired URL for scraping.
Run All Cells:

Execute the notebook cells sequentially to scrape, preprocess, and analyze the text.
View Results:

The notebook outputs the extracted named entities and may provide visualizations to illustrate their occurrences.
Outputs
Extracted Text: Cleaned text content scraped from the specified web page.
Named Entities: Categorized entities such as names, organizations, locations, and dates, presented in a structured format.
Visualization (Optional): Graphical representations of entity occurrences or text highlights.
Example Output
For example, running the notebook on a news article might output:

plaintext

Named Entities:
- PERSON: John Doe, Jane Smith
- ORG: OpenAI, Google
- GPE: New York, California
- DATE: November 14, 2024

##Concluding Note:

This notebook provides a practical introduction to combining web scraping with Named Entity Recognition. It can be extended to analyze multiple URLs, handle multilingual text, or extract additional entity types depending on the use case. This integration is particularly useful for building datasets, performing content analysis, or automating information extraction tasks.
