Mariah Carey performed and was honored with the Chart Achievement Award for her record-breaking single “All I Want For Christmas Is You.” After dropping into the stage via a ski lift, the Queen of Christmas transported fans into a winter wonderland that featured dancers on skates and backup singers including her children, Roc and Roe. Directed by the legendary Debbie Allen, this marked the first time in history the iconic holiday anthem was performed on an award show. Carey’s children presented her with the award and addressed her fans saying, “I kinda have to admit that some of the most memorable times in my career have been connected to Billboard and the BBMAs. This award is particularly special to me because the song itself changed my entire life.” To her fans’ amusement she jokes, “When I first sat down to write “All I Want For Christmas Is You,” I never could have imagined that I would be standing here three months later accepting this special award. Thank you to everyone who let this song become part of their holiday soundtrack each year.”
