# Reinforcement Learning (RL) Notebook

## Script Functionality
This notebook demonstrates reinforcement learning techniques, including environment setup, agent training, and evaluation.

The notebook includes:
1. **Environment Setup**: Creating or loading environments compatible with RL algorithms.
2. **Agent Training**: Implementing and training agents with algorithms like Q-learning or DQN.
3. **Evaluation**: Assessing agent performance over episodes.

## Requirements
The following libraries are required:
- `numpy`
- `gym`
- `tensorflow` or `pytorch` (depending on the RL algorithm used)

Install these with:

pip install numpy gym tensorflow  # or pip install numpy gym torch
Usage
Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook Reinforcement_Learning.ipynb
Run each cell to initialize the environment, train the agent, and evaluate performance.
##Outputs:
Training Logs: Reward logs or performance metrics over episodes.
Evaluation Metrics: Performance graphs showing the agentâ€™s learning progress.

##Concluding Note:

This notebook provides an introductory framework for reinforcement learning. Experiment with different environments and algorithms to deepen your understanding of RL.
