Script Functionality
This notebook performs a time-series sales forecasting analysis for Walmart, utilizing historical sales data and additional features that may impact sales trends. It aims to predict future sales and help understand factors influencing Walmart's sales patterns.

The notebook covers:

Data Loading and Exploration: Imports data from Walmart's historical sales records and the additional features.csv file.
Data Preprocessing: Cleans, transforms, and merges datasets as necessary, ensuring data quality for forecasting.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Provides initial insights through visualizations and summary statistics to understand sales trends, seasonality, and any correlations.
Forecasting Model Implementation: Implements time-series models, such as ARIMA, Prophet, or machine learning models like LSTM, to predict future sales.
Model Evaluation: Assesses model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or other time-series validation techniques.
Requirements
The following Python libraries are required for this notebook:

pandas: For data manipulation.
numpy: For numerical operations.
matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.
statsmodels: For statistical and time-series analysis.
fbprophet (if used): For forecasting.
tensorflow or pytorch (if using deep learning models like LSTM).
Install these dependencies using:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels fbprophet tensorflow

##Usage:
Load the Notebook: Open the notebook in Jupyter:

jupyter notebook walmart_sales_Forecasting.ipynb

Load Data Files: Ensure the features.csv file and any other required data files are in the same directory or provide the correct path in the notebook.

Run Cells: Execute each cell in sequence to load data, preprocess, explore, train models, and evaluate.

##Outputs:

Data Exploration Visuals: Graphs showing sales trends over time, seasonal patterns, and correlations with features from features.csv.
Forecast Results: Predictions for future sales with graphical representations for better insight.
Evaluation Metrics: Performance metrics of the forecasting model(s), showing accuracy and potential areas for improvement.

##Concluding Note:

This notebook provides a structured approach to Walmart sales forecasting, helping you explore various modeling techniques. By examining sales data and relevant features, this analysis can be further expanded to test additional models or alternative feature engineering approaches for improved accuracy.
