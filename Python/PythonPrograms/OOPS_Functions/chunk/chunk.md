## Script Functionality
This script reads a file in chunks of a specified size, printing each chunk to the console. It allows reading large files in manageable portions to prevent memory overload.

## Requirements
- Python 3

## Usage
1. Specify the file path and chunk size in the code.
2. Run the script:
   python chunk.py

##Outputs
Console Output: Prints each chunk of the file until the end of the file is reached or an error occurs.

##Concluding Note
This script is helpful for processing large text files in smaller chunks, making it memory-efficient and practical for data processing tasks.
