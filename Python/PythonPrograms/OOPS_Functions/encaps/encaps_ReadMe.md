# Patient Data Management with Encapsulation

## Script Functionality
This script defines a `Patient` class that demonstrates encapsulation principles:
1. **Public and Private Members**: The `name` and `age` are public, while `__medical_history` is private.
2. **Getter and Setter Methods**: Access and modify private data through public methods.
3. **Display Patient Info**: Displays a patient's name and age.

## Requirements
- Python 3

## Usage
Create a `Patient` instance and use the provided methods
# Example usage
python encaps.py
##Outputs

##Concluding Note
This script demonstrates encapsulation in Python, emphasizing secure access to sensitive data.
