# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Script Functionality
This notebook demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification tasks. It includes:
1. **Dataset Preparation**: Loading and preprocessing images.
2. **Model Construction**: Building a CNN model from scratch using Keras.
3. **Training and Evaluation**: Training the model on image datasets and evaluating its performance.

## Requirements
The following libraries are required:
- `tensorflow`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

Install these with:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook CNN.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook:
   - Preprocess the dataset.
   - Train the CNN model.
   - Evaluate and visualize the results.

## Outputs:
- Training Logs: Accuracy and loss metrics over epochs.
- Visualizations: Model performance graphs (accuracy/loss) and sample predictions.

## Concluding Note:
This notebook provides a practical approach to building and training CNNs for image classification. Experiment with hyperparameters and datasets to improve performance.
