# Vectorization with Chunking

## Script Functionality
This notebook covers the process of text vectorization and chunking for natural language processing tasks. It demonstrates:
1. **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization and cleaning.
2. **Vectorization**: Converting text into numerical representations.
3. **Chunking**: Breaking down sentences or paragraphs into smaller, meaningful chunks for analysis.

## Requirements
The following libraries are required:
- `nltk`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`

Install these with:
```bash
pip install nltk numpy pandas
```

## Usage
1. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Vec_with_Chunking.ipynb
   ```
2. Execute the cells to:
   - Preprocess textual data.
   - Vectorize sentences or words.
   - Perform chunking on text samples.

## Outputs:
- Tokenized text samples.
- Numerical representations of words/sentences.
- Examples of chunked text.

## Concluding Note:
This notebook introduces fundamental techniques for processing and analyzing textual data. Itâ€™s a starting point for NLP projects requiring tokenization, vectorization, or chunking.
