# Dog Classification

## Script Functionality
This notebook demonstrates how to classify dog breeds using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It covers:
1. **Dataset Loading**: Loading images of dogs.
2. **Model Design**: Building and training a CNN model for binary or multiclass classification.
3. **Evaluation**: Assessing the modelâ€™s accuracy on test data.

## Requirements
The following libraries are required:
- `tensorflow`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

Install these with:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook dogs_Classify.ipynb
   ```
2. Train the CNN model on a dataset of dog images and evaluate its performance.

## Outputs:
- Training Logs: Accuracy and loss over epochs.
- Model Predictions: Class labels for sample images.

## Concluding Note:
This notebook serves as an introduction to image classification using CNNs. Modify the architecture or dataset for advanced classification tasks.
