# Image Classification

## Script Functionality
This notebook implements an image classification pipeline using a CNN. It includes:
1. **Dataset Preprocessing**: Loading and augmenting image datasets.
2. **Model Training**: Training a CNN model on image data.
3. **Evaluation and Predictions**: Evaluating the model and making predictions on new images.

## Requirements
The following libraries are required:
- `tensorflow`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

Install these with:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook image_Classify.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the steps to:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Train and evaluate the CNN model.
   - Visualize results.

## Outputs:
- Model performance metrics.
- Prediction samples with class labels.

## Concluding Note:
This notebook demonstrates how to classify generic images using CNNs. Experiment with datasets and architectures to enhance results.
