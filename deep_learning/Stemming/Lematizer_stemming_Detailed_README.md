# Lemmatization and Stemming

## Script Functionality
This notebook explains the processes of lemmatization and stemming, which are fundamental techniques in natural language processing. It includes:
1. **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenizing and cleaning text.
2. **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base forms using language rules.
3. **Stemming**: Truncating words to their root forms for analysis.

## Requirements
The following libraries are required:
- `nltk`

Install this with:
```bash
pip install nltk
```

## Usage
1. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Lematizer_stemming.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the instructions to:
   - Apply lemmatization to text samples.
   - Perform stemming and compare results with lemmatization.

## Outputs:
- Lemmatized text samples.
- Stemmed text samples.

## Concluding Note:
This notebook highlights the differences between stemming and lemmatization, providing a practical guide for text preprocessing in NLP tasks.
