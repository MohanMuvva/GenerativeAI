# Data Standardization Script

This Python script standardizes an array of numerical data. Standardization involves rescaling the data so that it has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

## Script Functionality
- **Data Input**: Uses a predefined numpy array as input data.
- **Standardization Process**:
  - Computes the mean and standard deviation of the original data.
  - Standardizes the data using the formula \((data - mean) / std\_dev\).
- **Verification**:
  - Calculates the mean and standard deviation of the standardized data to verify the process.
##Usage
Prepare your Environment:
Ensure Python and NumPy are installed.
##Outputs
Console Outputs:
Prints the original mean, standard deviation, and the array of standardized data.
Displays the mean and standard deviation of the standardized data to confirm successful standardization.
##Concluding Note
This script is useful for preprocessing data in statistical analyses and machine learning models where data normalization is required to ensure consistent scale across variables.

##Additional Features
Expandability: This script can be modified to accept input from CSV files or other data sources.
Interactivity: Could incorporate user input for dynamic data standardization.
