# Taxi Fare Prediction Analysis

This Python script is designed to analyze taxi fare data to predict total amounts based on various trip features.

## Script Functionality
- **Data Loading**: Imports taxi fare data from a CSV file.
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Identifies and handles missing values and duplicates.
  - Converts specific fields to appropriate data types (e.g., categorical).
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Generates histograms for numerical variables to understand distributions.
  - Produces scatter plots and bar plots to visualize relationships between variables and total fares.
- **Predictive Modeling**:
  - Prepares data for modeling, selecting relevant features.
  - Splits data into training and testing sets.
  - Trains a Linear Regression model and makes predictions.
  - Evaluates the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score.
- **Visualization**:
  - Displays actual vs. predicted fares and relationships between different variables and total amounts using various plots.
##Usage
Setup:
Update the file_path to point to your dataset.
Ensure all required libraries are installed.

##Outputs
Console Outputs: Displays basic statistics, missing values, and model evaluation metrics.
Visual Outputs:
Histograms for trip-related numerical features.
Scatter and bar plots visualizing relationships and distributions.
A correlation heatmap to show feature interdependencies.
##Concluding Note
This script serves as a comprehensive tool for taxi fare analysis, utilizing statistical and machine learning techniques to predict fare amounts effectively. It is designed for scalability and can be adapted to various datasets or used as part of a larger data pipeline.

##Additional Features
Interactivity: Incorporation of user input to dynamically select variables for analysis.
Expansion: Extending the script to include more complex machine learning models or to integrate with a real-time data streaming platform for ongoing analysis.
